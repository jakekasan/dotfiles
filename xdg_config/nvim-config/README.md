# Nvim config

Used to be part of a dotfiles repo. Super annoying to edit that way.

## TODO

- [ ] add installer script that
    - [ ] checks expected symlink
        - [ ] if symlink exists, asks to update?
    - [ ] updates symlink with _this_ repo
    - [ ] has logging
    - [ ] tests using bats?
    - [ ] runs neovim to auto-install packages if it's first time?
